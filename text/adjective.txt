to be forgotten
to be seen
to be sensed
to be absorbed
to be amplified
to be attacked
to be bashed
to be perceived
to be guided
to be groped
to be illuminated
to be grasped
to be seized
to be stolen
to be wrecked
to be bent
to be beaten
to be blown
to be broken
to be burnt
to be chosen
to be dived
to be eaten
to be fought
to be flown
to be frozen
to be gone
to be hung
to be heard
to be known
to be left alone
to be risen
to be shown
to be sung
to be torn
to be thrown
to be woken
to be written
