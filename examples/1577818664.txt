She is
an unripe identity to crash
not everything to loosely deviate
not a fastidious language to bashfully observe
a wrinkled skin to chip
an wise echo to be frozen
a serene planet to be bashed
a seductive blank canvas to be broken
not a corrupting fear to be sung
a garrulous mouth to illustrate
a shy volcano to wreck
