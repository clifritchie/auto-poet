She is
a beautiful nothing to be chosen
a feckless flame to chip
a wrinkled skin to be beaten
not a deceptive destruction to be groped
a garrulous mouth to be guided
a persistent dream to be gone
a serene planet to be burnt
not a shy volcano to loosely deviate
not the impatient moon to be frozen
not a seductive blank canvas to be heard
