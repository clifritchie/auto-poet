She is
not a stranger to be known
not a tearful cloud to illuminate
a garrulous mouth to be chosen
a naive hand to be broken
not an animistic pain to amplify
an unripe identity to doubtfully paint
an innocent smile to repeatedly skip
not a feckless flame to shimmer
not a pervasive emotion to be burnt
not a vulnerable tear to guide
