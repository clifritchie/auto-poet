She is
not a naive hand to be bashed
not a timid voice to chip
a serene planet to be flown
not a rebellious rainbow to steal
a crude desire to be eaten
a wrinkled skin to be burnt
not an iceberg to sizzle
a corrupting fear to be blown
not an innocent smile to be left alone
not the impatient moon to wreck
