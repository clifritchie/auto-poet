She is
a deceptive destruction to be grasped
not an animistic pain to be wrecked
not an enticing glass to be amplified
not a whimsical wind to ignite
a garrulous mouth to politely hack
not an wise echo to questionably climb
not a tearful cloud to be stolen
an amatory feeling to crash
not a stranger to illuminate
not a crude desire to bashfully observe
