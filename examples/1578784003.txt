She is
not a naive hand to be seized
not a pervasive emotion to veil
not a serene planet to be torn
not a whimsical wind to press
a garrulous mouth to be frozen
an unripe identity to freely sense
an intransigent grief to grasp
a shy volcano to be wrecked
an enticing glass to be gone
not an irritable ear to be guided
