She is
a wrinkled skin to be gone
not a vulnerable tear to be frozen
a vacant heart to muse
an enticing glass to be known
not an unripe identity to be groped
not a seductive blank canvas to be perceived
an exquisit chant to greedily grope
a playful plant to chip
the sky to be burnt
a deceptive destruction to fondly see
